## Example Scenario

Suppose you run a SaaS company offering cloud storage. Noticing high subscription rates for the top-tier plan, you use our platform to create a custom metric to measure the impact of a 10% discount. A backtest shows positive past revenue effects, so you deploy the discount to a segment of new customers and observe real-time effects. Forecasts predict future growth impacts, allowing you to make informed decisions and roll out the discount to all customers.
